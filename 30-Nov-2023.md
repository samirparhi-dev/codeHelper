**Consolidation of Scan Reports :** I've developed a tool for consolidation, The 1st version of the flow diagram attached here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samirparhi-dev/catalyst/main/drawio-diagram/ConsolidatedStatic_code_analysis_report.drawio.svg .The code is currently on GitHub. It works well for JSON files less than 16 MB. However, when processing larger files, it encounters difficulties.

I've attempted to address this by:

- Increasing the heap size (still facing issues).
- Implementing the stream library instead of the JSON library in Python (still facing issues).
- Exploring the use of a server for JSON validation and serialisation (in progress).

**Analysis of CWE-789 :**  
- The file
 `
 hadoop/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/db/DBConfiguration.java
 `   has been examined, and an issue was identified. 

- According to the community, this file is customizable by end-users, posing no risk. 

- However, we believe this code block could be modified for security reasons, and pseudo code is already in place.
- The mentioned file has dependencies on other files, and the investigation is still in progress for further learning due to the extensive Hadoop code base. Preliminary study results have been recorded.
- The 1st version of code is https://github.com/apache/hadoop/compare/trunk...samirparhi-dev:hadoop:trunk . However it will go under Check for several review

**Generic Findings :**

- We encountered challenges during recent activities because of restrictions on Wipro laptop by scalar. Bringing personal laptops to the office isn't an option due to security reasons. Resolving this obstacle could significantly enhance our productivity. 
- A solution is to grant administrative access to the Wipro machine. This would require the teams to understand that the machine should be used exclusively for project-related and Wipro-specific tasks. Team members would assume responsibility for protecting the machine to the best of their knowledge. Addressing this issue in such a manner will improve our overall productivity.
